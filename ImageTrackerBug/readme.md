This is a test case for the bug reported in [this forum post](https://forum.magicleap.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360040943372).

Instructions:

1. Run it on the device. 
2. The application should hang during cleanup. If not, keep trying until it does.
3. Once this happens, terminate the application using your favorite method.
4. Now try running it (or other image tracking apps) again. Image tracking should fail to initialize.
5. Reboot the headset.
6. It should now work again.
